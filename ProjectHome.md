CLAHE stands for Contrast Limited Adaptative Histogram Equalization

(see "Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization" by Karel Zuiderveld, karel@cv.ruu.nl in "Graphics Gems IV", Academic Press, 1994)

I am not aware of any C++ implementation and I need it to work smoothly inside ITK. Hence this small project.
